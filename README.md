# Compute4COVID

This is a getting started guide for using GPUs in Covid19/nCoV2019 genomic research.

We currently have the following guides:

## 1. Long Read Basecalling

[Long Read Basecalling Guide](long_read_basecalling)

Using Bonito, a GPU-enabled basecaller, for SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequencing with Oxford Nanopore sequencing machines.

## 2. Short Read Alignment

[Short Read Alignment Guide](short_read_alignment)

Using the GPU-accelerated Parabricks BWA to align Illumina reads to a reference genome.

## 3. Long Read Polishing

[Polishing Guide](long_read_polishing)

Using [Racon](https://github.com/lbcb-sci/racon), a GPU accelerated polishing tool for long read based assemblies.
